  <p>This is an alpha release of the Winstone Servlet Container.  The homepage for this project is 
    at 'http://winstone.sourceforge.net'</p>

  <p>Author: Rick Knowles (contact details below)</p>

<h2>What is Winstone ?</h2>

  <p>Winstone is a servlet container that was written out of a desire to provide servlet
    functionality without the bloat that full J2EE compliance introduces.</p>

  <p>It is not intended to be a completely fully functional J2EE style servlet 
    container (by this I mean supporting extraneous APIs unrelated to Servlets, such as 
    JNDI, JavaMail, EJBs, etc) - this is left to Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, JRun, Weblogic et al. </p>

  <p>Sometimes you want just a simple servlet container - without all the other junk - that just goes. 
    This is where Winstone is best suited.</p>

  <p>The original goals in writing Winstone were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supply fast, reliable servlet container functionality for a single webapp per server</li>
      <li>Keep the size of the core distribution jar as low as possible (currently 120KB)</li>
      <li>Keep configuration files to an absolute minimum, using command line options to 
        optionally override sensible compiled in defaults. </li>
      <li>Eventually compile with GCJ to make a 3-4Meg windows exe for local development/deployment 
        of servlets. This has not happened yet, because of some GCJ class loading problems.</li>
      <li>Optionally support JSP compilation using Apache's Jasper. (http://jakarta.apache.org)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Using Winstone</h2>

  <p>If you want to build from source code, you will need to download and install Apache Ant. The
    following instructions assume you have already installed Ant and have the ant shell script in
    your path (to get Ant, see http://ant.apache.org/).</p>

  <p>To build Winstone, unpack the tree:</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>tar zxf winstone_src_v0.6.tar.gz</code>

  <p>Then build it:</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>cd winstone/development</code>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>ant dist</code>

  <p>To run it:</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar ../dist/winstone_v0.6.jar --webroot=&lt;location of webroot&gt; </code> (+ other options)

  <p> - OR - </p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -jar ../dist/winstone_v0.6.jar --warfile=&lt;location of warfile&gt;</code> (+ other options)

  <p>The winstone.jar file will be in the winstone/dist directory after the build is complete.</p>

</pre>

<h2>Configuration file</h2>

  <p>You don't really need a config file, but sometimes it's handy to be able to use the same settings
    each time without running through the command history.</p>

  <p>Winstone looks for a config file winstone.properties in the current directory (or in the location 
    specified with --config) at startup. It loads the properties in this file, overrides them with any
    supplied command line properties, and then starts itself.</p>

  <p>This is just intended as a handy feature for people who want to cache regular startup options, rather
    than using batch files.</p>

<h2>Why is it called Winstone ?</h2>

  <p>The short version (because the long version is way too politically incorrect) is as follows: </p>

  <p>Winstone is the name of a rather large Jamaican man a friend of mine met one night, while 
    he was out clubbing in the Roppongi area of Tokyo one night. He (my friend) was a little 
    liquored up at the time, and when Winstone suggested they head to "this really cool club" 
    he knew, he didn't think anything was wrong. It wasn't until Winstone led him down a dark 
    stairwell and dropped his trousers that my friend clued in and ran like hell.</p>

  <p>It was too good a story to let die, so I named this project Winstone so that said friend 
    will continue to be reminded of it. Heheheh ....</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <p>As a result of the design goals, there are some things Winstone doesn't do</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Winstone only supports a single web application per server. This is a deliberate limitation,
      intended to reduce complexity and therefore size.</li>
    <li>There are two connectors supplied with Winstone:
      <ol>
        <li>An internal HTTP connector - allows plain HTTP/1.1 connections only</li>
        <li>An AJP13 connector - allows connection to Apache/IIS/iPlanet, etc</li>
      </ol>
      There is no internal HTTPS/SSL connector included. If you need HTTPS support, I recommend using 
      Apache 2.0 with the AJP13 connector (instructions below).</li>
    <li>HttpSession support is cookie-based only (no URL rewriting). URL rewriting introduces a lot of 
      unnecessary complex request body processing, and given that browser cookie support is common these
      days (and no-one I know uses URL rewriting), I plan not to implement this.</li>
    <li>The messages are all in English only. These have been updated to use resource 
      bundles, but no translations yet.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Recent additions</h2>

  <p>New features in v0.5:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Implemented <b>DIGEST</b> and <b>CERT</b> authentication methods. The CERT type is largely untested 
      (due to lack of A: access to certificates and B: knowledge of browser configuration for client 
      certificates) - if anyone wants to help with testing this, I'd appreciate it.</li>
    <li>Implemented simple <b>clustering</b> (ie sharing of sessions between multiple Winstone instances).
      See below for cluster configuration details.</li>
    <li>Implemented optional <b>JNDI</b> support. This is just a memory-based Context intended for storing 
      lookups on <code>&lt;env-entry&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;resource-ref&gt;</code> references, but 
      it also includes a pooling JDBC DataSource object .... it's funny how you don't realise how important some
      things are until you go without them ....</li>
    <li>The control port has been modified to be more useful. See below for usage instructions.</li>
    <li>The distribution jar is now available in two forms:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Complete version</b> (winstone.jar - 185KB): This contains the complete winstone feature-set, 
          including AJP13 Apache connectors, Authentication/Realm support and Clustering support.</li>
        <li><b>Lite version</b> (winstone-lite.jar - 122KB): This is the core winstone feature-set only,
          ie commonly used servlet features, as fast and reliable as possible, with unnecessary options 
          removed.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>New features in v0.4:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Implemented the <b>&lt;error-page&gt;</b> directive</li>
    <li>Added object pools for request/response objects for performance reasons</li>
    <li>The handler pools are now controllable via startup properties</li>
    <li><b>Servlet reloading</b> is now supported (optionally - include 
      <code>--useServletReloading=true</code> at startup)</li>
    <li>The initial <b>Authentication Model</b> is in place (see below for help). There are two base 
      classes that make it work: <code>AuthenticationRealm</code> and <code>AuthenticationHandler</code>. 
      Currently Argument-based and File-based realms (ie user/password details supplied via command-line args 
      or XML files) and HTTP BASIC and FORM authentication are implemented, but the others (DIGEST and 
     CERT authentication forms) will come soon.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>New features in v0.3:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The request handler threads now use <b>monitors</b>, which allows them to exist beyond a single
      request/response cycle. The benefit here is performance - it removes a serious bottleneck.</li>
    <li><b>WAR files</b> are now supported via the --warfile attribute. If you specify a warfile in this 
      manner, it will be automatically extracted by the container to a temp directory, overwriting
      only files that are older than the archive date.</li>
    <li><b>Servlet attribute, session, and context listeners</b> (Servlet spec v2.3) are now fully supported. 
      The HttpSessionActivationListener class will be fully supported once the session transfer
      is implemented.</li>
    <li><b>Servlet Filters</b> (Servlet spec v2.3) are now fully supported.</li>
    <li>There is now an <b>AJP13 connector</b>, which means Winstone will now work behind Apache/IIS/etc
      using Tomcat's mod_jk. Try it out and see ... there's a section below on using the mod_jk connector.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Security Warning</h2>

  <p>If you enable the controlPort, be aware that any connection on that port whatsoever will 
    trigger a server shutdown. As shutdown is the only purpose of the control port at the moment, 
    it seemed fair to leave like this. As the admin features grow, I'll alter this.</p>

  <p>The controlPort is disabled by default. If you choose not to enable it, the only way to shut
    Winstone down is to kill the process (either by Ctrl-C or kill command). The reason I left it 
    disabled by default was because I don't like the idea of an nmap scan inadvertedly shutting 
    Winstone down.</p>

  <p>I'm open to help from anyone who's willing to help me meet the above goals for Winstone.
    Just mail me at the list (winstone-devel AT lists DOT sourceforge DOT net)</p>

<h2>JSPs (aka using with Jasper)</h2>

  <p>Winstone does support JSPs, using Apache's Jasper JSP compiler. Thanks to a rather clever 
    design by the Jasper team, this was much less work than I expected - well done Jasper guys.</p>

  <p>In order to turn on JSP compilation, you need to include the following additional jars in 
    the startup classpath:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>jsp-servlet.jar</b> - 
         This is a stripped down version of the tomcat servlet.jar. I removed 
         the javax/servlet and javax/servlet/http sections from the original 
         servlet.jar though, to avoid conflicts with Winstone's api classes. 
         This is in the Winstone development/lib folder.</li>

      <li><b>jasper-compiler, jasper-runtime.jar, ant.jar</b> - 
         Not supplied. You can get this from the standard Tomcat binary download location. 
         Just download the latest Tomcat, and copy these three files into the startup classpath 
         for Winstone. They will be in the tomcat_home/common/lib folder.</li>

      <li><b>tools.jar</b> - 
         You should already have this in the <java_home>/lib folder of your jdk. You'll need
         to add this, cause the ant javac compile task uses it, and this is needed to turn the
         generated .java files into .class files at runtime.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Adding files to the startup classpath involves using a slightly different technique for 
    starting Winstone. To start from the command line, you'll need something like:</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<code>java -cp ../dist/winstone_v0.6.jar:&lt;path to each jar above&gt; winstone.Launcher &lt;options&gt; </code>

  <p>Tomcat is available at http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html - but please note that the
    license for Tomcat is not the same as Winstone. Please read carefully before packaging.</p>

<h2>Connecting to Apache</h2>

  <p>These instructions are for beginners: if you know your way around Apache and Tomcat, you'll know what's going on here.</p>

  <p>Download and install Apache for your platform (and obviously Winstone too), then follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Download mod_jk2.dll/so into the apache modules directory</li>
    <li>Add the following to the apache conf file (httpd.conf): </li>
<pre>
LoadModule jk2_module modules/mod_jk2.dll

&lt;Location "/&lt;Winstone Prefix&gt;/*"&gt;
  JkUriSet worker ajp13:localhost:8009 
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
    <li>Create a new file called workers2.properties in the apache conf directory, with the following contents</li>
<pre>
# only in the beginning. In production comment out
[logger.apache2]
level=DEBUG

[shm]
file=c:/program files/apache group/apache2/logs/shm.file
size=1048576

# Example socket channel, override port and host.
[channel.socket:localhost:8009]
port=8009
host=127.0.0.1

# define the worker
[ajp13:localhost:8009]
channel=channel.socket:localhost:8009
</pre>
    <li>Start up Winstone and Apache and try connecting to the your webapp on the apache port, with the winstone 
      prefix. If it doesn't work, try looking at the apache error.log file for hints. If you get hex dumps, mail
      them to the winstone-devel list, together with any stack traces winstone generated.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please note this is not an optimal configuration for production uses. This is provided purely for those
    who need some help to get started. Read the mod_jk documentation with Tomcat for more detailed info.</p>

<h2>Using Authentication Realms</h2>

  <p>The process here is almost identical to that of Tomcat (I know this because I used the Tomcat examples
    webapp to develop against). There are two components - the web.xml component and selecting/configuring
    an AuthenticationRealm class.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The web.xml part is the same for all webapps - you include the <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code>
      and <code>&lt;login-config&gt;</code> elements as required, eg (from the Tomcat examples web.xml):
<pre>
&lt;security-constraint&gt;
  &lt;display-name&gt;Example Security Constraint&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;
    &lt;web-resource-name&gt;Protected Area&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/jsp/security/protected/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;DELETE&lt;/http-method&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;GET&lt;/http-method&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;POST&lt;/http-method&gt;
    &lt;http-method&gt;PUT&lt;/http-method&gt;
  &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;
  &lt;auth-constraint&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;tomcat&lt;/role-name&gt;
    &lt;role-name&gt;role1&lt;/role-name&gt;
  &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;
&lt;/security-constraint&gt;

&lt;login-config&gt;
  &lt;auth-method&gt;FORM&lt;/auth-method&gt;
  &lt;realm-name&gt;Example Form-Based Authentication Area&lt;/realm-name&gt;
  &lt;form-login-config&gt;
    &lt;form-login-page&gt;/jsp/security/protected/login.jsp&lt;/form-login-page&gt;
    &lt;form-error-page&gt;/jsp/security/protected/error.jsp&lt;/form-error-page&gt;
  &lt;/form-login-config&gt;
&lt;/login-config&gt;
</pre></li>

    <li>The AuthenticationRealm part is Winstone specific. Here you currently have three options:
      <ol>
        <li><b>ArgumentsRealm:</b> Here you simply add additional command line args for each user's password and
          role list. Passwords are added with <code>--argumentsRealm.passwd.&lt;username&gt;=&lt;password&gt;</code>, 
          and roles are added with <code>--argumentsRealm.roles.&lt;username&gt;=&lt;role1&gt;,&lt;role2&gt;</code></li>
        <li><b>FileRealm:</b> This is the same as the Tomcat <code>tomcat-users.xml</code> file. 
          Pass in the command line arguments <code>--realmClass=winstone.realm.FileRealm 
          --fileRealm.configFile=&lt;filename&gt;</code>, and it should work exactly the way Tomcat does by default.</li>
        <li><b>Write your own:</b> You just have to extend the <code>winstone.AuthenticationRealm</code> class,
          and override the appropriate methods (as the File and Arguments Realms do), and specify the class name in
          <code>--realmClass</code>.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This component is left intentionally fairly simple, and relatively extracted. I'm planning to break the realm and
    authentication stuff into an optional jar later, since not many webapps I've seen use it.</p>

<h2>Cluster support</h2>
  <p>It should be pointed out in the beginning that the Cluster support currently implemented in Winstone
    is actually just session sharing. If a request comes to a node in the cluster that doesn't recognise the
    session ID supplied, that node simply asks the others "Do you know this session ?". If one does know it, 
    it transfers the session to the requesting node, and the requesting node carries on as if it had always
    had the session in the first place.</p>

  <p>If a specific node in the cluster goes offline, so do all the sessions that it was holding. There is no
    active "push" of sessions to other nodes, so as far as resilience to failure goes, this cluster is 
    fairly weak. The clustering provided here is meant to allow a dumb load balancer to redirect requests
    randomly across a cluster of Winstone instances without requiring it to be "session sticky".</p>

  <p>That said, the configuration is fairly simple. The only information you need is the IP address and control
    port of at least one other active node in the cluster. Once you have that, add the following options to
    the command line startup:
<pre>
java -jar winstone.jar ...&lt; other options &gt; ... --controlPort=&lt;myControlPort&gt; --useCluster --clusterNodes=&lt;IP1:controlPort1&gt;
</pre>
    where IP1 is the IP address of the other node in the cluster, and myControlPort and controlPort1 are the port
    numbers to use for the control ports of this instance and the other node respectively. Note that it is necessary
    to actively set the controlPort on this instance, since it is disabled by default.</p>

  <p>You would likewise set up the other instance with reciprocal options (ie changing the IPs and controlPort values
    appropriately.</p>

  <p>NOTE: There are some additional requirements on your web application for Clustering of sessions to be 
    successful.
    <ol>
      <li>You need to include the <b>&lt;distributable/&gt;</b> element in your web.xml file. This tells Winstone that
        your webapp is programmed correctly to support clustering. If this is missing, clustering will be disabled.</li>
      <li>Any objects you add to the session must implement <b>java.io.Serializable</b>. This is required because
        Winstone serializes the objects in the session over the controlPort to other nodes, and reconstructs the
        serialized session at the destination. If you try to put a non-serializable object into the session, 
        Winstone will throw an exception reminding you to make all session objects serializable.</li>
    </ol></p>

<h2>Control port protocol</h2>

  <p>From v0.5, the behaviour of the control port changes slightly. Due to increased usage of the control port
    by the clustering function, a rudimentary protocol has been added. </p>

  <p>The protocol is very simple. The first byte sent to the server is a flag indicating what type of request
    is being issued. Beyond that the protocol varies for each request type, but the request type flag options
    are listed below:
    <ul>
      <li><b>0 (ASCII 48)</b> = shutdown</li>
      <li><b>1 (ASCII 49)</b> = request search for a session</li>
      <li><b>2 (ASCII 50)</b> = request list of currently connected cluster nodes</li>
      <li><b>3 (ASCII 51)</b> = cluster node heartbeat</li>
    </ul></p>

  <p>Obviously, unless you're planning to write your own cluster extensions, the only one you will be interested
   in is the shutdown option. To test this, simply telnet to the control port of a running Winstone server
   and type 0 once you have connected. It should begin shutting down immediately.</p>

<h2>JNDI support</h2>

  <p>I know that in the introduction I said that Winstone was only going to support the core servlet APIs, but
    I've since discovered that most people use just a little more than the core servlet API offers. For 
    example, some people use just a JNDI JavaMail session to send administrator error mails, while others want
    to offer a simple servlet over SSL (and hence need Apache), still others use just a JNDI DataSource
    to keep a reference to the connection pool.</p>

  <p>For this reason I've included a really basic optional JNDI service within Winstone. For the moment,
    it supports simple operations (such as bind, lookup, rebind, etc) and allows you to store references to 
    environment variables (drawn from the env-entry elements in web.xml and/or command line arguments).</p>

  <p>NOTE: JNDI support is disabled by default. It must be enabled using <code>--useJNDI=true</code></p>

  <p>Configuration can be done in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li><b>&lt;env-entry&gt; elements</b> - This is the standard way to add simple objects, such as
        sql strings or configuration integers/strings. For example:
<pre>
  &lt;env-entry&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-name&gt;test/hello&lt;/env-entry-name&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-type&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/env-entry-type&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-value&gt;45&lt;/env-entry-value&gt;
  &lt;/env-entry&gt;
</pre></li>
      <li><b>Command line arguments</b> - This is for more complex objects that require attributes
        to be created (JDBC DataSources for example). The syntax here involves adding a clause of the
        kind <code>--jndi.resource.&lt;resName&gt;=&lt;className&gt;</code> for each object to create,
        followed by <code>--jndi.param.&lt;resName&gt;.&lt;attName&gt;=&lt;attValue&gt;</code> for each
        attribute required. For example:

java -jar winstone.jar ...&lt; other options &gt; ... \

  <p>Additionally, it includes a JDBC DataSource object which can be used as a wrapper around normal JDBC 
    drivers. This is fairly simple for now, but it meets the requirements I mentioned above. Options are as
    follows:
    <ol>
      <li><b>url (REQUIRED)</b> - JDBC URL (<code>jdbc:mysql://db.widgets.com/db</code>)</li>
      <li><b>driverClassName (REQUIRED)</b> - JDBC Driver name (eg <code>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</code>)</li>
      <li><b>username</b> - username for database authentication</li>
      <li><b>password</b> - password for database authentication</li>
      <li><b>maxConnections</b> - Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool. Default is 20</li>
      <li><b>maxIdle</b> - Maximum number of idle connections allowed in the pool. Default is 10</li>
      <li><b>startConnections</b> - The number of connections to open the pool with. Deafault is 2</li>
    </ol></p>

  <p>For example to create a DataSource object at the JNDI location java:/comp/env/jdbc/connPool, use the 
    following command line (or config file) options:
<pre>
java -jar winstone.jar ...&lt; other options &gt; ... \
                        --useJNDI=true \
                        --jndi.resource.jdbc/connPool=javax.sql.DataSource \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.url=jdbc:mysql://db.widgets.com/db \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.username=foo \
                        --jndi.param.jdbc/connPool.password=bar
</pre></p>

<h2>GCJ compilation</h2>

  <p>I've had a little bit of success with this recently. Under the gcj folder in the source
    distribution there is a Makefile that I used to build Winstone to a native binary. It worked
    quite well - and to my naked eye, looked like lightning for static pages - except for 
    one problem: class loading.</p>

  <p>The problem is this: When you call "Class.forName(className)", the effect should be the 
    same as calling "Class.forName(className, true, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())", and 
    the short answer is that in recent GCJ versions, it's not.</p>

  <p>Recent GCJ versions use a "bogus" method to find the current class loader (their words 
    not mine). Basically GCJ generates a stack trace and walks back over it, trying to find a 
    class loader within recent memory. If none is found, it uses the system class loader.</p>

  <p>In most cases this is fine, but in a servlet container this is no good, because unless you
    have a webapp that has no WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes folders, you need to use a class
    loader other than the system classloader.</p>

  <p>One possible solution is to compile the webapp classes and Winstone into native binary format.
    This works except that if the servlet container tries to use another class loader anyway, you
    still have problems with which loader loaded which classes.</p>

  <p>To get around this, I have included an option "--useWinstoneClassLoader=false". This allows
    you to disable the webapp class loader, and operate entirely with a single class loader. This
    works ok for servlet-only environments, but it seems Jasper uses it's own classloader, so 
    you may still have problems in jsp + GCJ-compiled-Winstone environments.</p>

  <p>NOTE: The Makefile included uses Crimson as an XML parser, which has since been replaced 
    with the GNU XML parser due to License conflicts.</p>
