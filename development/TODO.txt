List of things to do:

Short-term
     - Control port password
     - Update to make winstone completely compliant with servlet 2.4 spec
     - Add additional listener class calls for request + attributes

Long-term
     - Additional control port options, such as manual webapp forced reload operation
     - In memory response cache for preset url patterns ? Not a good idea
     - Cache filter chain calculation for certain URLs
     - Add more automated tests as part of release process:
       - url matching
       - security / authentication
       - cluster resilience
       - ajp13 connector
     - More complete manual/documentation
     - Publish apidocs
     - Add a JSP compiler ?
