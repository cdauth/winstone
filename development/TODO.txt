List of things to do:

DONE - Add auto WAR extract instead of webroot
DONE - Change build process to use external ant
DONE - Add listener handlers, etc
     - Add security model - pluggable if possible, so Winstone can work in non-security mode
     - Refactor HttpConnector links, and try to build an ajp13 connector
     - Add filter handling code
