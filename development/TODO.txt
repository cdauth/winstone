List of things to do:

DONE - Modify the request handler thread to survive beyond a single request cycle
DONE - Add auto WAR extract instead of webroot
DONE - Change build process to use external ant
DONE - Add listener handlers, etc
DONE - Add filter handling code
     - Add authentication/security model - pluggable if possible, so Winstone can work in non-security mode
